reportMissingParameterType [boolean or string, optional]: Generate or suppress diagnostics for input parameters for functions or methods that are missing a type annotation. The self and cls parameters used within methods are exempt from this check. The default value for this setting is "none".

reportMissingTypeArgument [boolean or string, optional]: Generate or suppress diagnostics when a generic class is used without providing explicit or implicit type arguments. The default value for this setting is "none".

reportInvalidTypeVarUse [boolean or string, optional]: Generate or suppress diagnostics when a TypeVar is used inappropriately (e.g. if a TypeVar appears only once) within a generic function signature. The default value for this setting is "warning".

reportCallInDefaultInitializer [boolean or string, optional]: Generate or suppress diagnostics for function calls, list expressions, set expressions, or dictionary expressions within a default value initialization expression. Such calls can mask expensive operations that are performed at module initialization time. The default value for this setting is "none".

reportUnnecessaryIsInstance [boolean or string, optional]: Generate or suppress diagnostics for isinstance or issubclass calls where the result is statically determined to be always true or always false. Such calls are often indicative of a programming error. The default value for this setting is "none".

reportUnnecessaryCast [boolean or string, optional]: Generate or suppress diagnostics for cast calls that are statically determined to be unnecessary. Such calls are sometimes indicative of a programming error. The default value for this setting is "none".
